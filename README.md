Graceful degradation and service workers are related to each other since they both are focused on improving the user experience even when some featuers are not available. Graceful degradation aims to provide usability for an application even when some of the features are not available, and service workers allow for functionality even when there is poor network or offline. Also graceful degradation tries to allow for the main functions to be experienced even without some advanced features, which is similar to how service workers goal is to allow for functions to be run even when you are offline.
